Values are: tWTR 

tWTR (Write to Read Delay): Minimum time between a write operation and a subsequent read operation to different memory banks, ensuring data integrity and system stability.

Secondary timings complement primary RAM settings for fine-tuning memory performance. They include parameters like tRFC, tWR, and tFAW, crucial for optimizing RAM efficiency and stability.

0: Do Not Adjust (2400Mhz: ??) (CUST_ADJ only)
1: 10 (Default timing)
2: 8
3: 6
4: 4
5: 2
6: 1

The higher - the better, but might affect stability.
